                        iGen Education Trust is a non-profit organisation whose primary objective is to make higher
                        education
                        in South Africa accessible and equitable for every qualifying student. This will ensure that
                        quality
                        education becomes a reality for ALL university students in South Africa regardless of race,

                        Our desire is to give
                        each
                        student an equal chance to realize their full potential in life and contribute towards an
                        improved
                        quality of life for themselves and their families. In the long term, we see ourselves
                        influencing
                        the
                        design and delivery of education in South Africa. We believe high quality, purpose-driven
                        education
                        can
                        transform students into citizens who are able to contribute meaningfully in the provision of

                        27
                        universities in South Africa, and as funds grow, we intend to cover students studying
                        selected
                        courses
                        at other tertiary institutions in South Africa and other parts of the world.

                        Surplus funds may also be used to support the advancement of university programmes in order
                        to
