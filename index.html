                        education
                        in South Africa accessible and equitable for every qualifying student. This will ensure that

                        education becomes a reality for ALL university students in South Africa regardless of race,

                        improved
                        quality of life for themselves and their families. In the long term, we see ourselves
                        influencing
                        the
                        design and delivery of education in South Africa. We believe high quality, purpose-driven
                        education
                        can
                        transform students into citizens who are able to contribute meaningfully in the provision of

                    <p>By <b>harnessing</b> the immense power of <b>collective giving,</b> iGen enables students to
                        receive tertiary education so they are equipped appropriately to tackle poverty, unemployment
                        and inequality.

                    <br>
                    <h5>Why should I donate?</h5>
                    <p>Your donation goes towards funding students in financial need, making sure South African tertiary
                        education is <b>accessible</b> and <b>equitable</b> to all students. Almost all universities in
                        South Africa are battling with high student debt and do not have adequate funds to maximise the
                        impact of their offerings. By March 2019, students were owing different universities over R9
                        billion and we hope to assist in reducing this gap, and in eliminating it.</p>

                    <b>By donating at least R100 every month to iGen Education Trust, you can impact not just students

                    <h5>Where will my money go?</h5>
                    <p> All the funds collected go to iGen Education Trust. Eighty percent (80%) goes directly to
                        <b>student
                            fees</b> and one percent (1%) covers <b>operational costs.</b> The rest, nineteen percent
                        (19%),
                        is used for comprehensive marketing to drive <b>fund growth.</b>

                        having their own motivation for giving. For this reason, there are <b>three different
