                        education becomes a reality for ALL university students in South Africa regardless of race,

                        quality of life for themselves and their families. In the long term, we see ourselves

                        the
                        design and delivery of education in South Africa. We believe high quality, purpose-driven
                        education
                        can
                        transform students into citizens who are able to contribute meaningfully in the provision of

Almost all universities in South Africa are battling with high student debts and thus do not have adequate funds to maximise the impact of their offerings. By March 2019, students were owing different universities over R9 billion and we hope to assist in reducing this gap, and in eliminating it.
